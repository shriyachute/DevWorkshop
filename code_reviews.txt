1. Make sure you focus on test coverage being efficient and make sure your comments make sense for code reviews. 

2. I think this code review is good: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/287936/image-processing-application-in-c
I think this because they provide clear sections of code that are problematic and suggest alternatives that the programmer can then implement. They 
are also very direct in which specific functionality is problematic. 

3. I think this is not a great code review: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/280336/generic-function-accepting-object-and-validators-for-this-objects-fields
I think this because the review is very short and not as direct using words such as "could create" creates confusion for the programmer.
